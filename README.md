Extremely alpha state atm. 
Once it is stable I will add documentation on how to setup your own instance of SRSD ranked. 
Biggest bottleneck for this project is the more popular it gets, the more gameplay lobbies it needs, and the cost could quickly explode.
So best case scenario is many different people host their own instances of this plugin so players have more options.
